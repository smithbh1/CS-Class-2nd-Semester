            <h2>White Space and Clean Design</h2>
            <p>Apple</p>
            <a href="https://www.apple.com/" target="_blank">www.apple.com</a>
            <div class="applePhoto"><img src="images/apple.jpg" alt="screenshot of apple website"></div>
            <p>Even though there are a lot of boxes, colors, text, and other items on the page, none of those aspects
                seem “squished”. There is sufficient padding and margins so that all items on the page have enough “real
                estate” on the page according to their level of importance. Specifically, the 3 boxes and text shown all
                have a proportional space to take up, even on the mobile device view.</p>

        <section>
            <h2>Repetition</h2>
            <p>Uber</p>
            <a href="https://www.uber.com/" target="_blank">www.uber.com</a>
            <img src="images/uber.png" alt="screenshot of uber website">

            <p>The uber website has great use of repetition. Especially in the middle of the page, the different topics
                presented have the same place for an icon, the same heading font style, and similar length of text
                underneath. This repetition provides an aesthetically pleasing interface and provides a sense of
                organization and “cleanliness” to the site.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Contrast</h2>
            <p>Xbox</p>
            <a href="https://xbox.com/" target="_blank">www.xbox.com</a>
            <img src="images/xbox.png" alt="screenshot of xbox website">

            <p>Xbox utilizes great contrast, both in the text weight as well as the colors throughout the site. Although
                the text style throughout the site is relatively the same, they are able to compensate for that
                similarity by making the more important headings/content extremely large compared to the other text. The
                images provided throughout the page to advertise different games and consoles help provide contrast
                because of their abundance of color - the rest of the site is either white, gray, or “xbox green”, so
                adding red, blue, orange, gold, etc. lets the images stand out significantly more.
